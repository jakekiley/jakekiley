# Howdy! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jake Kiley, and I'm a remote Production Engineer (DevOps, SRE) at [WP Engine](https://wpengine.com/). I split my time between our App Dev and Automation team and the [Flywheel](https://getflywheel.com/) product line. I'm passionate about Kubernetes and Infrastructure as Code (IaC), and constantly exploring new ways to enhance automation and streamline workflows. 

As a lifelong learner, I'm always eager to expand my knowledge and skills by trying new tools, and technologies.

I live in the beautiful Black Hills of South Dakota. Previously, I've spent many years building websites and doing video production/editing.

You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/jakekiley/) or I might even rarely post on [jakekiley.com](https://jakekiley.com).
